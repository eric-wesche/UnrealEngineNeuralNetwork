# NeuralNetwork

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This uses the Neural Network Inference (NNI) plugin by Epic Games and Microsoft to run the yolov8n onnx model in Unreal Engine 5. 

I used code from here to read the frame asynchronously: https://github.com/TimmHess/UnrealImageCapture

I used code and gained understanding from this for how to use the NNI plugin: https://medium.com/@weirdframes/bringing-deep-learning-to-unreal-engine-5-pt-2-51c1a2a2c3

This thread helped me understand the outputs of yolov8: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/751
